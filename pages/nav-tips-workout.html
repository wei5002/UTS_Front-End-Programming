            <h5>Why do we need to warming up before exercise?</h5>
            <p>
              Warming up before exercise is a crucial step that many overlook,
              but it plays significant role in preparing the body for more
              intense physical activity. It gradually raises your heart rate,
              increases blood flow to the muscles, and enhances flexibility, 
              which in turn can improve performance and injuries. By Warming up,
              you're allowing the muscles to loosen up and become more flexible,
              thus can reduce the risk of injuries such as muscle cramps, strains, or sprains. 
              When you exercise without warming-up, your muscles are "cold" and stiff,
              making them more susceptible to injury.
            </p>
            <h5>Steps:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Light Jogging (3-5 minutes)</li>
              <li>Arm Circles (3-5 minutes)</li>

              Strengthening your arms is not only for enhancing muscle
              definition but also for improving overall upper body strength.
              Arm exercises pla a vital role in building endurance and making daily activities 
              like lifting, pushing, and pulling much easier.
              A regular arm workouts regimen not only builds muscle but also helps in 
              boosting stamina and reducing the likelihood of injury by increasing the support
              for the upper body. Push-ups are one of the most effective and accessible exercises for developing
              arm strength, while also engaging other muscle groups such as the chest,
              shoulders, and core.

              Strong legs are fundamental component of overall physical fitness and
              endurance. Leg workouts can improve not only muscle strength but also balance, stability, and
              coordination. Developinh your leg muscles also enhances athletic performance, 
              making activities such as running, jumping, or climbing more efficient. Squats
              are among the best exercises for targeting the lower body, as they work the major
              muscle groups, including quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Additionally, squats
              helps strengthen the core and improve posture, contributing to overall body functionality.

              A strong back is vital for maintaining good posture, balance, and overall strength.
              Including back exercises in your workout routine helps improve mobility and reduces
              the risk of injury, especially in the lower back. Strengthening back muscles can also
              alleviate back pain and imporve your posture, which is important for daily activities
              and sports performance. The bent-over row is an excellent exercise for targeting the upper back, shoulders, and arms,
              promoting a well-rounded upper body workout.

              Building a strong chest not only enhances upper body strength but
              also improves your overall physical appearance and athletic
              performance. Chest exercises, such as the bench press, target the pectoral
              muscles, which play a crucial role in pushing movements. By strengthening these muscles,
              you improve your ability to perform tasks like pushing, lifting, or carrying heavy objects,
              while also boosting muscle mass and endurance in the upper body.

              A strong core is essential for maintaining balance, stability, and
              overall strength. Abs exercises not only help sculpt your
              midsection but also support your posture and reduce the risk of
              injury during other workouts. One of the effective ways to
              strengthen tour core is through the plank exercise. The plank not
              only targets the abdominal muscles but also engages the shoulders,
              back, and glutes.

                Begin by getting into a push-up position with your forearms on
                the floor and elbows directly beneath your shoulders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, avoiding
                any sagging or arching in your back.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tighten your abdominal muscles and hold this positioning,
                keeping your gaze downward.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maintain the plank for 20-30 seconds, gradually increasing the
                time as you build strength. (3 sets of 20-30 seconds)

            <h5>Why do we need to cooling down after exercise?</h5>
            <p>
              Cooling down after exercise is just as important as warming up. It helps your body
              gradually return to its resting state by lowering your heart rate and blood pressure
              in a controlled manner. Cooling down also aids in preventing muscke stiffness and soreness
              by promoting blodd flow to remove waste products like lactic acid. Skipping
              this step could leave your muscles tense and fatigued, making recovery longer andincreasing the 
              likelihood of post-exercise discomfort. Cooling down exercises are simple and can include stretches and light movements
              to help release muscle tension and improve flexibility.
