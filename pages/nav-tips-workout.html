            <h5>Why do we need to warming up before exercise?</h5>
            <p>
              Warming up before exercise is a crucial step that many overlook,
              but it plays significant role in preparing the body for more
              intense physical activity. Warming up can reduce the risk of
              injuries such as muscle cramps, strains, or sprains. When you
              exercise without warming-up, your muscles are "cold" and stiff,
              making them more susceptible to injury.
            </p>

              Building a strong chest not only enhances upper body strengthbut
              also improves your overall physical appearance and athletic
              performance. Chest exercises target the pectoral muscles, which
              are responsible for pushing and lifting movements. Bench press is
              one of the most effective exercise for building strength and
              muscle. Whether you're using a barbell or dubbells, the bench
              press helps to develop upper body power and improve overall chest
              definition.

              A strong core is essential for maintaining balance, stability, and
              overall strength. Abs exercises not only help sculpt your
              midsection but also support your posture and reduce the risk of
              injury during other workouts. One of the effective ways to
              strengthen tour core is through the plank exercise. The plank not
              only targets the abdominal muscles but also engages the shoulders,
              back, and glutes.

                Begin by getting into a push-up position with your forearms on
                the floor and elbows directly beneath your shoulders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, avoiding
                any sagging or arching in your back.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tighten your abdominal muscles and hold this positioning,
                keeping your gaze downward.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maintain the plank for 20-30 seconds, gradually increasing the
                time as you build strength. (3 sets of 20-30 seconds)

            <p>
              Cooling down after exercise is an essential practice that many
              people tend to overlook. It serves several important purposes for
              the body, helping it transition from an elevated state of exertion
              back to a resting state. Cooling down can aid in preventing muscle
              stiffness and soreness, reduce the heart rate gradually, and
              promote relaxation.
